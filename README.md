# scaramaster
<b>SCARAmaster - a simple control interface for SCARA</b><br><br>
Autoit3 script that allows the direct control of SCARA robotic arms, creation of movement seqences and provides a communication overlay.<br>
Through the overlay, the movement sequences can be called by external commands (either command line, or standard input/output).<br><br>
This script uses the Serial port/COM port UDF by Martin Gibson (https://www.autoitscript.com/forum/topic/128546-serial-port-com-port-udf/). Required dll library commg.dll can be downloaded from Martin's website (https://www.mosaiccgl.co.uk/AutoItDownloads/confirm.php?get=COMMGvv2.zip). The file then needs to be placed in the same working directory with the script to work.
